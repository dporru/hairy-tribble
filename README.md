# Tribble

Tribble is work in progress. The first goal is creating a minimal viable product
for teachers to help them create and organise their tests. Current code is meant
to explore the problem space.

## Running

Easiest way to run the current version is using docker. The docker image `dporru/tribble`
is automatically build from master.

```
$ docker run -d dporru/tribble
```
